#+title: My AwesomeWM config
#+author: Hp


This is my dotfiles for my AwesomeWM machine, including dots for tools I used.

My dotfiles and configs are purely functional for me. I like things looking nice, but never at the cost of workflow optimization. I like fitting lots of things in my screen. Of course, if something looks nice, then I won't complain. I still use picom for the love of god.

* READ THIS!
This repo is meant to be used as my backup repo. I *STRONGLY* advise against blindly copy everything to your home folder. You should know what you're putting in your machine. This is meant to be a source of inspiration and reference.

My config also goes through several iterations of changes and optimization. What you see in the photos today might not be there tomorrow. It's probably available in the repo history somewhere though. Ask me if you have any questions.

* Why is everything so large?
I'm using a 7 inch umpc, hence the scaling needs to be that way. The plus side is it makes for good demonstration and screenshots. You can scale back the DPI with the file =~/.Xresources=.

* Usage
I run the script ~backup.sh~ periodically to copy all my personal dotfiles to this repo and upload it to github.

+If you want to install everything as is what I have though, run the file installscript.sh.+ (You could, but don't do that.)

*You really should open the files you want to use first and read it through. Comment out or delete the stuff you don't want installed on your own system.*

Ideally, if I were you, I'd look into which tools I'd like to check out, and only copy the dotfiles of that tool. E.g, if I want to check out this repo's AwesomeWM config, I'd go ahead and copy ~awesomebackup/.config/awesome~ to my ~.config~ folder

* Extras
** Scripts
There's a bunch of scripts I wrote and find useful in =~/.config/misc/= folder. Check it out if you like. The dmenu script to launch scripts is ~dm-scriptlauncher.sh~.

** Dmenu
I use a lot of dmenu for my workflow convenience. Dmenu scripts are listed as =dm-= something in my scripts folder. I find dmenu the perfect menu for scripting, and I don't find the need to use anything else.

You can find a dmenu fork repo that I use personally in my github profile.

** Emacs
I use emacs as my main text editor, thus my config files are heavily skewed towards making emacs integrate with the system. There's also a basic neovim config in here if you want to use that.
